    # Wait for the user to authenticate and be redirected to the redirect_uri
    # This is a placeholder for now, as Dash doesn't support waiting for a user action
    # You can use a callback with a delay to periodically check if the user has been redirected
    # Or you can use a different approach to handle the OAuth flow, such as a Flask app
    # or a separate web server to handle the OAuth redirect and obtain the access token
    # For example, you can use the requests_oauthlib library to handle the OAuth flow
    # Here's a simple example:
    # https://requests-oauthlib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/oauth2_workflow.html#implicit-grant-flow
    # You can also refer to the Dash OAuth documentation:
    # https://dash.plotly.com/authentication
    # Note that the implicit OAuth flow is not recommended for web applications,
    # as it is less secure than the authorization code flow.
    # It's recommended to use the authorization code flow instead.

    # Once you have the access token, you can use it to make authenticated requests to the StackExchange API
    # For example, you can use the requests library to make authenticated requests
    # Here's a simple example:
    # access_token = 'YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN'
    # headers = {'Authorization': f'Bearer {access_token}'}
    # response = requests.get('https://api.stackexchange.com/2.2/me', headers=headers)
    # print(response.json())
